# deep_learning_wine

*Description*
This model aims to predict the quality of red wine as a score. The input is constituted of different features which are explained below: 
Fixed acidity :	most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile
Volatile acidity:	the amount of acetic acid in wine
Citric acid:	the amount of citric acid in wine
Residual sugar:	the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops
Chlorides:	the amount of salt in the wine.
Free sulfur dioxide:	the amount of free sulfur dioxide in the wine(those available to react and thus exhibit both germicidal and antioxidant properties)
Total sulfur dioxide:	amount of free and bound forms of SO2
Density:	the measurement of how tightly a material is packed together
PH:	describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4
Alcohol:	the percent alcohol content of the wine
Quality:	output variable (based on sensory data, score between 3 and 8)
